\ bubble.fth - a bubble sort of pseudo-random cells: loops, memory, compares.
\
\ The owner's RelF benchmark (RelF/bench/bubble.4 in his collection,
\ forth.tgz), its words as they were, ELEMENTS 300 and not 6000 so a timed run
\ stays near the others (Iteration 128; Iteration 127 had the program of
\ RelF's bench/langs/bench.4). DO loops over addresses with CELL +LOOP, 2@ and
\ 2!, a compare and a swap: execution, where parse - which it replaced in the
\ selection, with ackermann.fth - is the interpreter. VERIFY-LIST aborts if
\ the list is not sorted, and BENCH prints its first and last cells, so a
\ design that sorts wrongly shows.
