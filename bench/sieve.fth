\ The sieve of Eratosthenes, as the BYTE benchmarks of 1981 ran it: 8190
\ flags, the primes counted, the whole repeated. The HELD-OUT workload
\ since Iteration 41, when loop joined the selection: what evolution does
\ not see, to show whether what it selects for carries over. Memory - C@
\ C! FILL - and a BEGIN ... WHILE ... REPEAT inner loop, which none of the
\ selected workloads leans on. Written in CORE words only, as the others.
\ 1899 primes; the count is printed, so a design that gets it wrong shows.
