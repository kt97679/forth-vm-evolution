\ ackermann.fth - Ackermann's function: deep recursion and nothing else.
\
\ The owner's RelF benchmark (RelF/bench/ackermann.4 in his collection,
\ forth.tgz) as it was - his -ack, with 1 -1 D+ for A(x-1,1) - NUM 5, not 3,
\ so a timed run stays near the others (Iteration 128; Iteration 127 had the
\ textbook definition). fib.fth recurses some 25 deep; this goes hundreds
\ deep, and its data stack with it. A(3,5) = 253, by 42,438 calls; the value
\ is printed, so a design that gets it wrong shows.
