# Progress log

Append-only: one entry per session, newest last. A wrong entry is
corrected by a later one that says so, not edited (prompts/12-progress-log).
History before this log: the git log, `FINDINGS-*.md`, `lab/*/README.md`.

## 2026-10-03 - Claude, commits 868c4c3 .. this one

**Done.** The evolution lab's gene pool grew: superinstructions (pairs from
each design's own profile), run-time fusion, relf's format-10 opcodes
(eleven words and two short branches), the escape, tail-call threading,
multi-state stack caching with composed pair effects. The evolver was made
trustworthy: four genome-to-image mapping bugs, a survival check that
never checked the kernel was written, runaway designs contained, a
mutational scan, a deterministic resume, and the design built is now the
design recorded. Measurement is the process's CPU time, paired with s6.
Also: every image reproducible (the SPN savers), READ/WRITE as SPN
stencils (parse 0.974), line-at-a-time ACCEPT (5-14% faster on stdin,
seeds bootstrapped), and `prompts/` from relf with this log and
`GOALS.md`.

**Measured.** A full rehearsal on the VM (1,306 designs; `REHEARSAL.md`)
and the first run on the Ryzen (`results/evolve-amd-ryzen-7-pro-8840hs-
seed1.md`): measured again, 0.609 of s6's CPU time at 13,480 bytes, and
0.649 at 9,801. Both searches found the same kind of design.

**Failed, reverted or rejected** - each in `GOALS.md`'s register: run-time
fusion; the first ACCEPT (3-11% slower); multi-state caching with 25
operations (lost); a retry added on a wrong diagnosis; the claim that
multi-state caching buys less on Zen 4.

**Learned.** Every bug that cost a run lived in how the lab built or
recorded designs, not in the designs: the lesson of the four mapping
bugs, the unchecked kernel, the forked resume and the raw genome. And a
selected front re-measures 3-6% worse: quote `--remeasure`.

**Open.** `GOALS.md`, "Next". Pick up first: the knockout study.

## Iteration 1 - 2026-10-03 - Claude

**Correction to the entry above.** It ended with a handoff named
`forth-vm-evolution.bundle`, as every handoff before it was. That is
prompts/07-git-handoff's placeholder, not a name: 07 asks for
`project-claude-iterN-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.bundle` unless the project has its
own convention, and this one had none written down. The user caught it.

**Done.** The convention is now in `GOALS.md` ("Conventions"), where 07
says to look before a handoff; `tools/make-bundle.sh` follows relf's
script - N from HEAD's `Iteration N:` subject, UTC time, HEAD and master,
the clone check, the path printed. Handoffs are numbered from this one.
`lab/evolve/RUNNING.md` names the bundle by the convention.

**Open.** Unchanged - `GOALS.md`, "Next". Pick up first: the knockout study.

## Iteration 2 - 2026-10-04 - Claude

**Search first (prompts/12):** "knockout", "ablation", "contribution" in
GOALS.md, PROGRESS.md and lab/evolve - only the plan; no prior attempt.

**Done.** `evolve.py --knockout [ID,...] [--rounds N] [--db FILE]`: for
each design, every gene that differs from hand-made s6 set back to s6's
value, one at a time, and measured again. Shaped by prompts/03 and 11:
every figure labelled measured; a calibration against known answers (s6
against itself: speed 1.000, size exactly 10,065; the design itself
measured again in the session); the ways it can mislead stated in the
report (knockouts are in context and do not add up; "also changed" lists
what moved with a gene - the escape takes its slots, undoing multi-state
caching wakes the tail calls a genome carries dormant); for pasting back,
machine and commit in the report, progress on stderr.

**Tried here (VM, one design, 1-2 rounds) - not results.** It runs end to
end: s6 against itself 0.992 and 1.024, size exact. At one round the
noise is large - the pairs' knockout came out +22% in one run, +4% in the
next - so the default stays 6 rounds.

**Open.** Run on the Ryzen. Pick up first: its report.
