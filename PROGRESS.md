# Progress log

Append-only: one entry per session, newest last. A wrong entry is
corrected by a later one that says so, not edited (prompts/12-progress-log).
History before this log: the git log, `FINDINGS-*.md`, `lab/*/README.md`.

## 2026-10-03 - Claude, commits 868c4c3 .. this one

**Done.** The evolution lab's gene pool grew: superinstructions (pairs from
each design's own profile), run-time fusion, relf's format-10 opcodes
(eleven words and two short branches), the escape, tail-call threading,
multi-state stack caching with composed pair effects. The evolver was made
trustworthy: four genome-to-image mapping bugs, a survival check that
never checked the kernel was written, runaway designs contained, a
mutational scan, a deterministic resume, and the design built is now the
design recorded. Measurement is the process's CPU time, paired with s6.
Also: every image reproducible (the SPN savers), READ/WRITE as SPN
stencils (parse 0.974), line-at-a-time ACCEPT (5-14% faster on stdin,
seeds bootstrapped), and `prompts/` from relf with this log and
`GOALS.md`.

**Measured.** A full rehearsal on the VM (1,306 designs; `REHEARSAL.md`)
and the first run on the Ryzen (`results/evolve-amd-ryzen-7-pro-8840hs-
seed1.md`): measured again, 0.609 of s6's CPU time at 13,480 bytes, and
0.649 at 9,801. Both searches found the same kind of design.

**Failed, reverted or rejected** - each in `GOALS.md`'s register: run-time
fusion; the first ACCEPT (3-11% slower); multi-state caching with 25
operations (lost); a retry added on a wrong diagnosis; the claim that
multi-state caching buys less on Zen 4.

**Learned.** Every bug that cost a run lived in how the lab built or
recorded designs, not in the designs: the lesson of the four mapping
bugs, the unchecked kernel, the forked resume and the raw genome. And a
selected front re-measures 3-6% worse: quote `--remeasure`.

**Open.** `GOALS.md`, "Next". Pick up first: the knockout study.
